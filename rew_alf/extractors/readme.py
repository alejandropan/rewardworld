README extractors

1. Make sure that the flags for extraction are correctly postioned in
each session. These are: extrac_me.flag and opto.flag

2. Run extract.py (in rewardworld) on the root folder (not the folder of an
individual session). 

3. Run opto extractor (run extact from opto extractor on roor folder). It now runs
just with the extract me flag.
